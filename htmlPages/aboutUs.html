                <p>
                    We are Sandra (Celine) Jammal and Hossen Yassen, passionate software engineering students. As part
                    of our academic journey, we developed a JavaScript-based project called <strong>Phone Book</strong>,
                    which helps users organize and manage their contacts with ease.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to build intuitive and user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems. We
                    believe in continuous learning and collaborating to create meaningful, efficient solutions that can
                    make everyday tasks simpler and more organized.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    As students, we have tackled various challenges, developed skills in coding and problem-solving, and
                    worked on diverse projects. We are excited to share <strong>Phone Book</strong> as one of our
                    milestones and are constantly working to improve it and grow as developers.
                </p>
